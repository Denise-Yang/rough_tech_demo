/*
10/6/2019 - Deliverable
- create character lines (opening, counteroffer, threat, accept,leave)
- go to next line after user inputs a price
- implenting charisma bar (did not get to)
- adding character (did not get to)
__________________________________________________

Current implementation:
- have lines appearing in a text box
- have code for deciding when which line should appear
- have an input box for the user

Issues:
- have trouble accessing user input in dialogueManager
-
